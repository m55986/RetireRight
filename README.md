Retire Right is an interactive financial-planning simulation that helps users understand how investment
behavior influences long-term retirement outcomes. The project provides a simple, beginner-friendly interface
where users can select investment strategies, track their progress through a visual progress bar, and see how
market conditions affect their total savings.

Users can:
-Earn simulated income
-Invest using different strategies
-Experience market changes
-Track progress toward retirement goals
-See deterministic market outcomes for learning purposes

How We Built It:
Designed a simple HTML interface with input buttons and a progress bar.
Implemented investment logic in JavaScript with deterministic rates for predictability.
Built a progress system that fills based on total savings.
Styled the experience using responsive CSS for clarity and accessibility.
Tested multiple investment cycles to ensure outcomes felt educational but intuitive.
